            <p>
                In <span>2015</span>, humanity was on the verge of extinction.
                It is assumed that this was a <span>virus.</span> It is not known who created it and for what purpose, but the person who picked it up was considered <span>dead in life</span>.
                The first symptom is a cough.
                A few hours after infection, the man looked as if he had been starving for several months. Pale skin, sunken eye sockets, this is the first thing that catches your eye.
                After that, the man had to live for about an hour. But this was not the worst thing. The people infected by the virus <span>did not die forever</span> ...
                They came back, but came back with others ... It was a long time predicted by the science fiction <span>"zombie apocalypse"</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is assumed that everything began in southern Africa, and there should have ended, since the military quickly took action.
                There was a <span>real massacre</span>, in just a few hours more than 99% of the population of Africa was destroyed ...
                It was decided not to risk. People were shot from the ground and bombed from the air, there was <span>no salvation</span>.
                From the continent were exported and saved only a few. But the virus was too tenacious. Outbreaks of the disease began to occur <span>around the world</span>, destroying whole cities.
                In just six months, half the world's population died out. After that, for some unknown reason, the virus stopped hitting people.
                By this moment of normal life, an end has come. Any big city was just killing dead. The governments ceased to exist, the armies were no more.
                But there was a new misfortune, <span>the living dead</span> - those people who died, infected with the virus, clearly wanted to eat. <span>The struggle for survival began</span> ...
