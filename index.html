    <p>In this game you need to defeat the real zombie apocalypse. Once scientists invented a virus that suddenly began to turn living people into zombies,
        and to resurrect the dead and turn them into zombies. You play the role of an ordinary policeman - a destroyer of zombies, who was not ready for the zombie attack of the apocalypse.
        This cool uncle in glasses and with a large backpack, which was sent on a mission, the purpose of which is the destruction of all zombies.
        They wandered everywhere and now wander about in search of food, so bloodthirsty and insane. You have three types of weapons. You can walk and kill zombies as you think,
        the main thing is not to get under their bites.</p>
    <p>You have to fight alone against a whole army of aggressive zombies!
        Often in wars with zombies the task of "winning" is not even put!
        The only thing you can strive for is to survive. Either for some time, when government troops and doctors will appear and clean the territory of this merzote,
        or until they can escape to some other place where the zombie is not and was not. And, hopefully, it will not.</p>
    <p>Try to play as if you are a real zombie opponent, arrange real zombie attacks, just tear them apart, you have to stop this apocalypse.</p>
